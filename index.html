    <h2>What Is Glögg?</h2>
    <p>Glögg is Swedish infused wine. 
        Usually served during the holiday season, 
        it's similar to mulled wine — but it's not quite the same thing (glögg is a bit more involved). 
        Traditionally, the drink is set on fire so the sugar granules completely dissolve.</p>

    <h2>Glögg Ingredients</h2>
    <p>These are the ingredients you'll need to make this traditional Swedish glögg recipe:

        Alcohol: This big batch Swedish glögg recipe is quite boozy. It calls for a combination of port wine (don't throw away the bottles!), bourbon whiskey, and white rum.
        Spices: The glögg gets its warm and cozy flavor from cloves, a cinnamon stick, and cardamom pods. A strip of orange peel lends fruity flavor.
        Sugar: Sweeten things up with ¾ cup white sugar.
        Raisins and almonds: Raisins and almonds lend subtle, yet welcome, flavor.</p>
